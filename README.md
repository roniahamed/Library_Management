## üìã Project Overview

This Library Management System is a robust web application designed to digitize and streamline the core functionalities of a physical library. Built on the powerful Django framework, it provides a seamless experience for both library members and administrators.

The project's architecture demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated Django apps for handling user accounts, book catalogs, categories, and financial transactions. A key feature is the integrated user wallet system, which requires users to deposit funds before they can borrow books, simulating a real-world library membership or fee-based model.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîê User Account Management
- **Secure Registration & Authentication**: Full user registration, login, and logout capabilities with password management.

### üìö Core Library Functions
- **Dynamic Book Catalog**: A comprehensive display of available books, filterable by category.
- **Book Returning System**: Users can return borrowed books from their profile, which makes the book available for others.

### üîß Administrative Tools
- **Django Admin Panel**: A powerful backend interface for complete control over the library's data.
- **Book & Category Management**: Administrators can easily add, update, and delete books and categories.
